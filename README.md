# Facet-Defining Inequalities for a Crew Scheduling Substructure

This repository accompanies the Operations Research submission on
facet-defining inequalities for an integrated staff rostering and task assignment problem.

## Contents

This repository contains:

1. **Benchmark instances** adopted from  
   *A shift-based model to solve the integrated staff rostering and task assignment problem with real-world requirements*.

2. **Instance generation procedures** used to create additional test cases
   beyond the original benchmarks.

3. **Complete computational results** for all tested instances, including
   the raw Excel files used to generate the tables reported in the paper.

## Repository Structure

- `result/`  
  Raw computational results (Excel files).

- `appendix/`  
  Benchmark instances in paper *A shift-based model to solve the integrated staff rostering and task assignment problem with real-world requirements*.

- `src/`  
  Scripts used for instance generation.

## Reproducibility

All appendix tables in the paper are generated directly from the Excel files
provided in this repository.
